## Usage
To use, simply visit [!this link](https://demilletech.github.io/eamonn-random/Web/VATSIMAircraftGenerator/index.html).
At the moment, the code is written for flights from JFK. To make it work with your own airport, edit `genflight.js`
to have your airport in the `dep_arpt` var.

## API Key
This requires a Google Maps API key. Please view [!this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22294128/how-can-i-get-google-map-api-v3-key)
to see how to obtain one. It needs to be inserted into `index.html`, on the line that contains the Maps API call, as the `key`
GET variable.
