# Basic networking template

## Usage
You can copy this as much as you like. In order to use, your server needs the classes in the `server` package. Your
client needs packages in the `client` package. All the javadoc is self-explanatory. Should be very easy to implement.

## License
All under `beer-ware` license. Do whatever you want with it. If you meet me some day and think it's worth your time, buy
me a beer in return.

## Support
No, I won't support this. If I have genuinely written incorrect code, then please, let me know with an issue under the
issue tracker. Other than that, you're on your own.
